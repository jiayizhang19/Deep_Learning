A neural network consists of **input**, **hidden layers** and **output**
- input: contains data set features
- hidden layers: a neural network can contain any numbers of hidden layers
- output: contains predictions

#### Trainable parameters:
- Weights: Each weight connects one neuron to another in the next layer. It determines how much the influence of a given input feature has on the output
- Bias: It allows the model to shift the activation function to better fit the data.
